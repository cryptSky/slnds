1. Build the project. Example:
```
cd candy-machine-mint
yarn install
yarn build
```

2. Define your environment variables using the instructions below, and start up the server with `npm start`.

#### Environment Variables

To run the project, first rename the `.env.example` file at the root directory to `.env` and update the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_CANDY_MACHINE_CONFIG=__PLACEHOLDER__
```

This is a Solana account address. You can get the value for this from the `.cache/temp` file. This file is created when you run the `metaplex upload` command in terminal.

```
REACT_APP_CANDY_MACHINE_ID=__PLACEHOLDER__
```

Same as above; this is a Solana account address. You can get the value for this from the `./cache/temp` file. This file is created when you run the `metaplex upload` command in terminal.

```
REACT_APP_TREASURY_ADDRESS=__PLACEHOLDER__
```

This the Solana address that receives the funds gathered during the minting process. More docs coming as we can test this.

```
REACT_APP_CANDY_START_DATE=__PLACEHOLDER__
```

This is a unix time stamp that configures when your mint will be open.

```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
```

This identifies the Solana network you want to connect to. Options are `devnet`, `testnet`, and `mainnet`.

```
REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC_HOST=https://explorer-api.devnet.solana.com
```

This identifies the RPC server your web app will access the Solana network through.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
